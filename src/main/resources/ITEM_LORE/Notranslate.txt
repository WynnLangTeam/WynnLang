§8This was fashioned out of the@ 
§8shell of a dead Snail from@ 
§8the Sky Islands. Maybe its@ 
§8defensive properties can be@ 
§8used to your benefit...@ 
§8A poor imitation of the rare Statue@ 
§8boots, and fashioned out of@ 
§8diamonds. It will do as a@ 
§8temporary substitute...@ 
§8Strangely enough, these boots were@ 
§8found in a house at the Olux@ 
§8Swamp. What sort of@

§8This crafted Fantasia gets kind of@ 
§8close to real Fantasia in@

§8Fire 6 btw@ 
§8It is unknown how these pair of@ 
§8boots came to be, but they@ 
§8seem to be a good pair to@ 
§8keep around@ 
§8After the shortcomings of the@ 
§8Gargoyle Boots MK I, the@ 
§8overall design have been@ 
§8revamped with the help of@ 
§8Corkian Engineers. If only@
